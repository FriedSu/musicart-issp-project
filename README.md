# Musicart Project
***
This Musicart website allows the user to type in songs in an advanced search bar and select the desired songs from a library using Spotify's API. The selected songs are automatically inserted into a popular Spotify playlist which is related to the selected songs. To access the service, the user would have to register an account, log in, and pay.

The website will contain a payment page where the user can buy a certain amount of play. The amount of plays will dictate the amount of songs which can be added to a playlist. 

The goal of this website is to help artists gain more exposure to Spotify's listeners and potentially gain new fans.
